## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found this challenge to be very helpful with providing more context to box modeling and how I am able to adjust how I need. I also added some hover elements to my repertoire that I will definitely like to use in future projects. Even though I assume my code is jumbled to the more well-versed coders I think I am seeing improvements to the readability or at least I am understanding more how to interpret mine and other code which is very helpful when it comes to seeing how some others accomplished the same ideas. 
### Continued development

I definitely need to take a deeper dive into mobile development and how that plays into my code. I'm not quite grasping how to make my page responsive on mobile and keep a solid layout. I also would like to keep working on cleaning up my code as I feel like I had to expand a lot where there is likely much more concise ways of doing the same thing.
